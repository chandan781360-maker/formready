<h2>About FormReady</h2>

<p>
FormReady is a simple online utility designed to help users prepare photos,
signatures, and documents exactly as required for online forms.
</p>

<p>
Many government portals, job applications, admission forms, and banking services
reject uploads due to incorrect file size, dimensions, format, or background.
FormReady solves this problem by providing precise resizing, compression, and
format conversion tools in one place.
</p>

<p>
Our goal is to make form submissions stress-free by ensuring files meet
real-world portal requirements before upload.
</p>

<p>
FormReady works directly in your browser and does not require any software
installation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> FormReady is an independent utility and is not affiliated
with any government authority.
